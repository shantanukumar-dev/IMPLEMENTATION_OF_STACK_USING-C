stack always perform LIFO(last in first out)
Here insertion operation is known as push(). 
Here deletion operation is known as pop(). 
There are various application of the stack:-
         1.Expression evaluation
         2.Funcation calls
         3.Memory management
         4.Recursion
         5.Backtracking
